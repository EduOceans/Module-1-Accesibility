## Introduction

Our marketing agency website is a crucial tool for presenting our services to potential clients and partners. This README provides an overview of recent updates, including accessibility enhancements and code refactoring.

## Changes

### Accessibility

In an effort to make our website more inclusive and user-friendly, the following accessibility changes have been implemented:

- **Semantic HTML**: The HTML structure has been revised to use semantic elements, ensuring a more meaningful document outline for screen readers.

- **Alt Texts for Images**: All images now include descriptive alt text, enhancing accessibility for users who rely on screen readers.

- **Color Contrast**: Color contrast ratios have been reviewed and adjusted to meet accessibility standards, ensuring text and interactive elements are easily readable.


### Refactoring

The codebase has undergone a series of refactoring to enhance maintainability, readability, and performance. Key refactoring changes include:

- **CSS Cleanup**: The stylesheets have been refactored to remove redundant styles, improve naming conventions, and enhance overall consistency.

- **Bug fixes**: All the links have been checked and fixed to point/navigate to the right areas on the website.
